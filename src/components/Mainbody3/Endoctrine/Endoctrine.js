                           <p>Exercise places a major challenge on body due to increased energy needs
                               and physiological demands put upon the body's nervous , muscular , cardiovascular , metabolic 
                               and respiratory systems. As a body goes through these responses and subsequent adaptaions to 
                               exercise, there are number of complex hormone interactions occouring simultaneously
                           </p>

                           <p>The Endoctrine System influences almost every cell,organ, function of the body and 
                               helps to maintain Homeostasis.It is instrumental in regulating mood , growth and development
                               tissue function , protien synthesis , metabolism , sexual function and reproductive process

                               as cell groth. Faster processes like breathing and body movements are controlled by
                               the nervous system

                        <p>The pituitary gland is located at the base of the brain beneath the hypothalamus and is no
                           larger than a pea. It is often considered the most important part of the endocrine system 
                           because it produces hormones that control many functions of other endocrine glands. When 
                           the pituitary gland does not produce one or more of its hormones or not enough of them, 
                           it is called hypopituitarism.
                        </p>

                        <p>The pituitary gland is divided into two parts: the anterior lobe and the posterior lobe.
                           The anterior lobe produces the following hormones, which are regulated by the hypothalamus:
                        </p>

                                 proper amounts of body fat and muscle and bone mass. It is also
                                 involved in emotional well-being.)

                            <p>Exercise has profounf effect on the function of a number of glands and their corresponding 
                             effect on a number of systems through the release of specific hormones.The first gland to exibit
                             a response through exercise is pituitary gland. this structure produces and secretes a number of 
                             different hormones for  different purposes, of which the Human Growth Hormone(HGH)
                             is the most important. HGH plays important role in adapting to the stress of resistance training
                             by enhancing amino acid uptake by cells and protien synthesis in skeletal muscles resulting in
                             hypertrophy of muscle fibres
                            </p>
                            
                            <p>HGH supports the action of cortisol by decrerasing glucose uptake by tissues and increasing free
                             fatty acids mobilization to enhance gluconeogenisis in liver. It also stimulates the release
                             of insulin like growth factor (IGF-1) that works togehter with GH to stimulate muscle growth
                           </p>

                        <h2>Hypothalamus</h2>
                        <p>The hypothalamus is located in the lower central part of the brain.
                           This part of the brain is important in regulation of satiety, metabolism,
                           and body temperature. In addition, it secretes hormones that stimulate or
                           suppress the release of hormones in the pituitary gland. Many of these hormones
                           are releasing hormones, which are secreted into an artery (the hypophyseal portal system)
                           that carries them directly to the pituitary gland. In the pituitary gland, these releasing
                           hormones signal secretion of stimulating hormones. The hypothalamus also secretes a hormone
                           called somatostatin, which causes the pituitary gland to stop the release of growth hormone.

                              <p>The thyroid gland is located in the lower front part of the neck. It produces thyroid hormones
                                 that regulate the body's metabolism. It also plays a role in bone growth and development of the
                                 brain and nervous system in children. The pituitary gland controls the release of thyroid hormones.
                                 Thyroid hormones also help maintain normal blood pressure, heart rate, digestion, muscle tone, and 
                                 reproductive functions.

                          <p>The two adrenal glands are triangular-shaped glands located on top of each kidney. 
                             The adrenal glands are made up of two parts. The outer part is called the adrenal
                             cortex, and the inner part is called the adrenal medulla. The outer part produces
                             hormones called corticosteroids, which regulate the body's metabolism, the balance
                             of salt and water in the body, the immune system, and sexual function. The inner part,
                             or adrenal medulla, produces hormones called catecholamines (for example, adrenaline).
                             These hormones help the body cope with physical and emotional stress by increasing the
                             heart rate and blood pressure.

                           The pancreas has digestive and hormonal functions. One part of the pancreas, the exocrine pancreas,
                           secretes digestive enzymes. The other part of the pancreas, the endocrine pancreas, secretes hormones
                           called insulin and glucagon. These hormones regulate the level of glucose (sugar) in the blood.

                       <p>The reproductive glands are the main source of sex hormones. In males, the testes, located in the scrotum,

                          sperm production. In females, the ovaries, located on both sides of the uterus, produce estrogen and progesterone
                          as well as eggs. These hormones control the development of female characteristics (for example, breast growth),
                          and they are also involved in reproductive functions (for example, menstruation, pregnancy).

                        <p>Manipulation of exercise protocols can maximize the neuroendoctrine response. Exercises that stimulate
                            this system include training large muscle groups such as Legs,Chest,Back. Compound movements like Olympic
                            Lifts,Deadlifts and Jump Squats have shown to produce large elevations in testosterone as compaired to 
                            small muscle-mass exercises. These exercises done prior to smaller exercises significantly increase the amount
                            of testosterone circulating in the blood

                        <p>Aslo the type of exercise and how exercise is performed is essential to eliciting a significant
                            neuroendoctrine increase of testosterone concentration. The intensity,Volume and Rest being the major
                            factors in programming. The ideal programming for a good acute testosterone response according to "kraemer
                            et al" 2005 is high volume withmoderate to high resistance. Other factors that influence acute response include
                            age,sex and training status. Some researches shows that testosterone ;evel also trasiently increases in women
                            after resistance training but this testosterone response is blunted in post-menopausal women
                        </p>
                        <p> Growth Hormone level also rise and remain higher for upto 30 minutes after resistance training
                            .Growth Hormone is anabolic in sense that it boosts collagen synthesis around the muscle but research 
                            does not support the idea. It does seem to have anticatabolic effect on muscle reducing muscle breakdown
                            in response to catabolic hormones like coristol. Growth Hormones have other benifits. It increases
                            bone mineralization, supports the immune function and acts directly on fat cells(lypolysis) to release
                            stored fat. This works in favour for an individual trying to shread body fat

                        <h2>Hormonal Response To Endurance Training</h2>
                        <p>The Hormonal response to endurance exercise varies with duration and intensity of exercise.
                            Intense exercise above the lactate threshold increases growth hormone level while long period
                            of moderate-intensity endurance exercise lowers growth hormone levels. In addition, long period of
                            endurance training greater than an hour , leads to more sustained rise in coristol. Thats one reason
                            why long periods of moderate intensity cardio breaks down muscle tissue , increases the catabolic effects
                            of coristol without the growth activity of growth hormone and IGF-1
                        </p>
                        <p>Excessive cardio lowers testosterone and estrogen levels in women. Overall moderate intensity endurance exercise
                            has catabolic effect on muscle tissues and make it more challenging to develop lean muscle mass

                        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                        <p>High-Intensity exercises like heavy resistance training and High-intensity Cardio increases 
                            testosterone, Growth Hormone, IGF-1. Endurance exercise have opposite effect. Although both high
                            intensity and moderate intensity exercise elevate coristol level, the catabolic effects of coristol
                            are somewhat offset by anabolic effects of testosterone,growth hormone and IGF-1
